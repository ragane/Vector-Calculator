#Vector-Calculator

My first project on Github and cpp.
This trivial calculator was developed by me to perform simple operations on up to 3 vectors. 

The action that is performed is:

        adding and subtracting vectors to each other,
        scalar product of vectors,
        multiplying vectors by number,
        calculating the modulus of vectors.
